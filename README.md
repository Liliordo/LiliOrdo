### Hello! 
My name is Liliana.

I am currently a Colombian Fulbright scholar at Rutgers University. I am passionate about understanding how people relate to the space they inhabit and including this perspective in analyzing and implementing public policies. I have over six years of experience working with the public and private sectors on housing affordability, housing tenure, and property rights.

In particular, I have recently focused on studying the implementation of a new cadastral system in Colombia and its implications on the distribution of rural land and peasants’ rights. This policy results from the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla, signed in 2016.

I have skills and experience working with ArcGIS, Excel, Stata, and Illustrator.
